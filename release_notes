1.02.01
- Added explicit close/join to multiprocessing pools in all parallel operations
- Simple fixes for GCC 10.3 compiler


1.02.00

- Added native presumed PDF tabulation capability, with the TabProps code from the University of Utah providing optimized Clipped Gaussian and Beta PDF integration. In serial this implementation is typically ~5x faster than a related internal code at Sandia, and through Spitfire's interface it may run in parallel for extreme speedup of the PDF convolution.

- Added a configuration file to check the git status of a Spitfire buid/release to help with downstream SQA.

- Add several thermochemistry datasets relevant to hydrocarbon pool fires simulations at Sandia.
