Continuation
============
This section is under construction and its topic (continuation methods) is under construction!

Theory
------

Natural continuation with Euler-Newton, Euler-[any-solver] approaches

Pseudo arc-length continuation

Pseudotransient continuation


Application to Combustion Problems
----------------------------------

S-curve 0-D, flamelet

ignition-extinction 0-D, flamelet
