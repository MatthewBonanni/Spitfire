Spitfire is an open source Python/C++ scientific computing code for chemistry and reaction-diffusion problems related to combustion and porous material decomposition. Spitfire is primarily used at Sandia National Laboratories to build advanced nonpremixed flamelet libraries for large-scale accidental fire simulations and small-scale pool fires.

Documentation in the form of background, demonstrations, and installation instructions can be found on our [RTD page](https://spitfire.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).
